# The "Rock-Peper-Scissors" Game
# Project goals
The project presents a console game in which the user chooses rock, scissors or paper. A random selection of the possibilities is then generated by the computer. The two choices are compared against certain rules of the game. Finally, the program shows who is the winner of the game and how many points he has collected.
